# EMI Analyzer

This repository contains the project files for the EMI Analyzer developed for Purdue University's [SMART Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SMARTLab).

## nRF52 Code

The code located in the prototypeCode folder is for the nRF52840 Dev Board. The NRF SDK and Keil are required to compile and load this code to the dev board. Once you have the SDK, you can replace the main and config file of an example and copy the two AD5933 files to the same directory as the main file.

## ESP32 Code

This is the old code for the first prototype design that was put aside for the newer NRF prototype. I still have the code here for reference, but will probably remove it at some point.
